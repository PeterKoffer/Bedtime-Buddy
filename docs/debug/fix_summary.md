# Fix Summary: Settings Panel, Localization, Connectivity hints, Placeholder enforcement

Date: 2025-10-05
Root: /workspace/shadcn-ui

Changes
- Added Settings panel with runtime overrides:
  - /src/components/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx
  - Inputs for OPENAI_API_KEY_OVERRIDE and OPENAI_BASE_URL_OVERRIDE
  - Save/Clear/Test actions, localized toasts and labels
- Updated App to mount Settings and show LanguageSwitcher:
  - /src/App.tsx
  - Added header nav, Settings button, conditional SettingsPanel
- Finalized localization resources (default Danish, English toggle):
  - /src/i18n/locales/da.json
  - /src/i18n/locales/en.json
  - Keys for connectivity, settings, avatar flow, badges, common nav
- Enforced localization and placeholder in AvatarGenerator:
  - /src/components/character/AvatarGenerator.tsx
  - Localized remaining strings, added connectivity badge, guaranteed placeholder on failure

Verification
- Build: pnpm run build â€” passed
- Default language: Danish; LanguageSwitcher toggles to English
- Settings overrides: persisted to localStorage; Test button reports connectivity status codes
- Network shape: /images/generations uses application/json body; /chat/completions uses JSON with image_url entries
- Placeholder: renders reliably when generation fails or key missing
